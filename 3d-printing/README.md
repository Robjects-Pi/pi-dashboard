For a sleek enclosure, there are several 3D printed cases available for this touchscreen:

 > - Note: In future projects for Robjects, I would love to incorporate more customized 3D prints with extra features pertaining to specific builds (i.e. incorporating a extra component or mount for a raspberry pi camera). If you are interested in contributing or working along side, please refer to jobs I need help on <!—— TODO: Add link here —>.
 I do plan to eventually hire freelancers and hired help once the YouTube Channel, so if you worked with me before, I would gladly compensate you fairly for the support if you are interested.
